# documentation
In this folder you can find some notes I make while learning Kubernetes, Docker, Golang, React, Neovim and more!

Please note, sometimes the work is incomplete and in progress. I am simply sharing my personal notes and hope it pushes you in a direction where you might be stuck in a Google abyss.

Please send me a mail petrusjohannesmaas@outlook.com if you want to chat/have any questions. Let's figure it out together!
